Merc Management  

## Motivations
- I love learning new things.
- I want to build tools that make it easier for people to do their own work.
- I want to help others do well, whether that be by cheerleading, knowledge 
  sharing, or collaborating.
- I actively avoid work that has ethical or privacy concerns, or is harmful 
  (dark ux, ad tech, user data collection, etc)

## Projects where I've succeeded and that I've enjoyed doing

- I do well in projects where I feel like I have some ownership and input into
  the design and implementation. In practice, that process has usually been me
  taking over a broken or troubled system that is business critical but
  neglected, figuring out where it is failing, and then fixing it.
  - **Example**: I redesigned and implemented a realtime data pipeline using
  kinesis and lambda; that work is detailed in a [talk I gave at PyCon 2016](https://youtu.be/EpCHD10AIHAM)
- I have also had success pairing with a teammate to discuss and scope a body of 
  work, breaking that work down into actionable items, and systematically 
  attacking it until its done.
  - **Example**: Simon and I both noticed that our documentation was disorganized
  and incomplete. We worked together to come up with a guide for how to write
  documentation, created individual tickets for each task, and then split the
  work. In ~3 weeks we had completely migrated and improved the documentation
  for Sensu-go from a github wiki to docs.sensu.io.  
- In addition, I've enjoyed building integrations to services (pagerduty, slack,
etc). These are often small, focused task with well-defined inputs and outputs.

## Projects where I've not done my best, or been very unhappy
- I don't do well in projects that have dominant leads who are reluctant to
    share the work. I'm very cautious about stepping on other people's toes or
    jumping in to help if I'm not explicitly invited to do so. 
- I tend to flail on implementing something if the reason for the implementation
    or intended usage is unclear, or keeps changing during the course of the
    project.
  - **Example**: At a previous company, the team began building a system without
  defining clear needs and goals from external stakeholders. This made it very
  tough for me to determine what I should be working on; attempts at clarifying
  the importance of work were generally unsuccessful, because we didn't know
  what the requirements really were.

## Daily work and communication 
- **Availability**: I'm generally available within the hours of 8am - 7pm pacific. Mornings tend to
be reserved for any communication methods that need my attention: meetings, code
reviews, email, slack, etc. I'm more productive in the afternoons and prefer to
keep them free to concentrate on writing code. Occasionally I will split my day
and work a bit later in the evening if there is something I need to do during
business hours. I will always put this in the AFK calendar, but will not always
remember to broadcast this to the team unless I mention it in standup.
- **Pairing**: I often reach for a pair when I need to spec out work (design phase),
if I have a question about something in the codebase, or if I'm running into a
problem I need help fixing. These sessions are usually short and focused, after
which I usually work independently. If I am pairing 100% on a task, I need to
ensure I take breaks at a maximum of every hour and a half. Sometimes I forget
to take breaks and end up very mentally fatigued, after which I can come across
as a bit grumpy.
- **Feedback**: I prefer to be honest, direct, and explicit, but kind when I am
giving feedback and expect others to do the same with me.
- **Showing my work**: I am quick to champion the work of others, but need a lot of
help promoting and showing off my own. I do enjoy demoing work that I've done,
but I don't feel comfortable showing unfinished work. I very much prefer to have
a day to prepare for a demo so I can ensure I am ready to do so and have answers
to questions folks might have.
- **Collaboration enablers**: I'm a little shy and really leery of stepping on
other's toes when determining work to do or collaborate on, as I've had some
negative experiences trying to get involved with work I'm interested in that
others are not willing to collaborate on. Invitations to collaborate and discuss 
work are very helpful for me. Planning for collaboration (ie a scheduled time
for pairing or discussion) are generally preferred over ad-hoc.
- **Getting unstuck**: Sometimes it's helpful for me to have a tiny task I can do
when I'm stuck and can't get help quickly. I also take breaks and physically
remove myself from the keyboard when I run into issues I'm not immediately able
to solve. I'm usually able to solve the problem quickly when I return.
- **Saying no to things**: I'll say no if I feel overwhelmed or feel like
someone has crossed a boundary or pushed one of my buttons. I will often say no
if I'm put on the spot to do something publicly, unless it is something that
I'm very comfortable with or have done before.

## Moods
- Sometimes I have personal things going on that I'd like to keep private, but
it's hard for me to part with my emotions during my work day. As such, I might
come across as grumpy and will tend to be quieter in group conversations. If I
am unhappy about something going on at work, and that is affecting my mood, I
will tell you about it, and will ask for your help if it's something I need
assistance resolving. TLDR - if I seem unhappy about something, it might not be
work related - please ask if you are unsure!
- I'm usually really happy and excited to complete a task and ship it, and I
don't think I do a good job of communicating that in a text medium (ie slack). 

## Goals
- Get better at talking about and demonstrating the work I'm doing
  - I'd love to do more writing (technical blog posts), short demos/how-tos, and less conference
  presentation style demonstration.
- Strengthen and expand the operations knowledge I already have
- Identify the CS gaps I have and work to close them
- Work on some actionable, business related tasks that solve real problems

## Learning
- **List of books I'd like to get through**
  - **A Philosophy of Software Design**: I tend to get hung up on design
  decisions and project structure when starting new projects. I'm hopeful this
  book can teach me a few things about that.
  - **Language Implementation Patterns**: This book has a number of exercises
  that walk through building code generators and simple compilers, which is
  something I've wanted to learn for a long time and could be very useful to my
  current work.
  - **Docker/Kubernetes**: I have a general understanding of how these
  technologies work together, and I'd love a business use case to help me really
  learn how to use them.

## What I need from my manager
- Help me set reasonable and achievable goals, and let me know how I'm doing
periodically so I don't worry about my progress.
- Explicit and actionable feedback, delivered kindly as early as possible.
- Help me learn how to demonstrate and talk about my work. Many of my previous
managers have done this on my behalf to the company _without my prior knowledge_, or encouraged me to
talk about my work doing public speaking. I'm not used to doing this to the
company at large.
